                <h3>Programming</h3>
                <p class="skill-desc">My first programming class is during my 3rd year in college while I was taking BS
                    Mechanical Engineering. I could say I was one of the best in our class as it's one of the rare
                    subjects I excelled at. I was amazed with the subject and found my self enjoying it. I couldn't
                    afford to shift major back then due to financial restrictions so I finished my ME course and worked
                    for 7 years before taking another diploma course in Computer Science. It took me another 2 years to
                    finish the diploma course but after all that, I've finally transitioned from being a Mechanical
                    Engineer into my current career.</p>

                <h3>Basketball</h3>
                <p class="skill-desc">One of my favorite sports is basketball. I usually play a lot of it if I'm not in
                    front of my computer. I admire the acrobatic stunts of Michael Jordan and the hassle defense of
                    Dennis Rodman. My friends usually comment on my play as aggressive and unorthodox. Unorthodox
                    because usual shots are boring to me. I always make an acrobatic attempt to shoot the ball to avoid
                    being blocked by the defender.</p>
